# COP2210_Project-TheaterKiosk

This project was developed as part of the mid-semester course project for my Programming 1 class (COP2210) at FIU. The provided
code is a solution to the task given:

A theater seating chart is implemented as a two-dimensional array of ticket prices, like this:

10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 

10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10 
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10 
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10 
20 20 30 30 40 40 30 30 20 20 
20 30 30 40 50 50 40 30 30 20 
30 40 50 50 50 50 50 50 40 30

Write a program that prompts users to pick either a seat or a price. Mark sold seats by changing the price to 0. When a user specifies a seat, make sure it is available. When a user specifies a price, find any seat with that price.


I developed a more advanced solution to this problem. My code includes:

- A menu for the user to select a seat by price, specific seat, and view available seating
- Implemented user-error prevention when entering invalid prices, invalid rows, and unavailable seating
- Implemented row letters and seat numbers for each row

I did my best to make my code feel like a legitimate movie theater kiosk that lets the user choose and reserve seats, and pay for their seat; just like kiosks at actual movie theaters.

My grade for the project was a 110/110 (100%). My solution to the task given at hand is proven to be viable and advanced.
